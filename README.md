### Description

This teaches you how to use the webbrowser control. It can upload/stuff stuff, can be used to play online games, can be used for online chat, is faster because of its small amount of options and is free. Just for you to wow at, this code submission was done using Net Free 1. See? A vote in appreciation will encourage me to make versions even faster. E-mail me at: "yangzeqi@hotmail.com
 
### More Info
 
This is very limited, watch out fo version 2 beta. The favourites section will not retain the added items, I hope to fix this by version 3.
